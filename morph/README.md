Explanation of your project: A user can input two images in order to morph them together as one image.

What did you plan to accomplish? We hoped the program would be similar to what it currently does, but a bit more user friendly, 
    in that they wouldn't need to change the name of their image.
    
Where could you envision this project going? If you had more time, what would you have done? 
    In the future we would like to implement a website that anyone could access and find by simply typing in "morph" as a keyword.

Description of how to use the application:

Use images within a similar size to 600x800

Step 1:
Import image into the morph folder

Step 2:
Go to the file named "points.py" go to line 37 and enter the name of the desired image.
Do this for both images.

Step 3:
Go to the file named "faceMorph.py", go to line 73 and 74. Change those image names 



Step 4
Go to faceMorph.py on line, 73 & 74, change the image names to your image name of the two pictures you are using. Run it.
